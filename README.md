## Features

 The application is written using React and formatted with Chakra-ui styles and components, and a custom colour palette. It is deployed to GitHub Pages. It is a single page application, and was written with a mobile-first, responsive design.

It uses the Atkinson Hyperlegible font, which was designed to increase legibility for readers with low vision. It is free to use and can be downloaded from the [Braille Institute](https://www.brailleinstitute.org/freefont). The motivation for this choice was that the author of the portfolio is an optometrist and is passionate about accessibility.

The application has the following features:

- A navigation bar with links to the different pages of the site.
- The landing page is the 'About Me' page, which contains a short bio and a photo of the developer.
- The 'Portfolio' page contains a list of recent projects that the developer has worked on, with links to the deployed applications and the GitHub repositories.
- The 'Contact' page contains a contact form, which can be used to send a message to the developer, and it has other contact details.
- The 'Résumé' page contains the developer's résumé, and a link to a version which can be downloaded as a PDF file.
- The footer contains links to the developer's GitHub, Twitter and LinkedIn profiles.
- It is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) and it can be installed, and it has a service worker which caches the application for offline use.
