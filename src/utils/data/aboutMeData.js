  aboutText: [`I'm a self-taught hobbyist programmer with over 30 years of casual experience in Windows development. 
  A life-long learner, I'm updating my skills through a comprehensive full-stack web development bootcamp from EdX and the University of Adelaide. 
  Through this I'm acquiring proficiency in HTML, CSS, Tailwind-CSS, React, MySQL, MongoDB, Express, and Node.js allowing me to move my technology stack to
  an open-standards, device-independent, cloud-based paradigm.`, 
  `This rigorous program complements my understanding of the backend, enabling me to take on comprehensive web development projects that I can also integrate with bespoke Windows software.`,
`Over the years, I've successfully implemented technology solutions in my own multi-location optometry practice, developing and deploying 
a point of sale system, a clinical records system, and integrations between my practice software and Xero and Cliniko through their RESTful APIs.`, 
`In the past I have developed a staff rostering system which was adopted by an optometry company with over 200 branches around Australia and New Zealand.`,
`My goal is to leverage this blend of extensive experience and freshly acquired full-stack web development skills to create streamlined, efficient digital solutions. 
I am currently open to part-time roles and internships in the web development space, eager to contribute to meaningful projects that drive business value.`],
